• Hello, hello, hello.
• This is Testing.
• What I am testing right now is uploading an audio and sending it to my Pi and transcribing it to my Pi and giving it to OpenAPI and summarizing it.
• There is a fallback in that.
• If there is no OpenAPI key, it has to be summarized in T5 Smalls and updated in my interface.
• This is what I am trying.
• Let's see the result.
