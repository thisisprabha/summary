• Hello guys, now I'm speaking in Tamil.
• I don't know how this will come.
• I'm just trying to open it.
• The result I expect is that I have to translate it in Tamil.
• I have to summarize it and add it to the meeting notes.
• This is my concept.
• But I don't know how this will come.
• I'm testing it.
• Since I'm speaking in English and Tamil, I don't know how to process it.
• Let's see.
