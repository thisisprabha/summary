• Hello!
• I am currently speaking in Tamil.
• Do you know how the death penalty is carried out?
• It is a topic that my brother is interested in.
• I remember a simple request that came in Tamil enhances the testimony.
• I am summarizing it that way.
• We need to jot down meeting notes today.
• This is my favorite topic.
• I know how it works.
• I am testing this.
• If I mix a lot of English while speaking, it might be difficult to understand.
• I don't have the idea of how to process it.
• Let's see.
