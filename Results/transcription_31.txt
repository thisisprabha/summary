• Hello guys!
• Today I will be speaking in Tamil.
• It's not a problem if you don't understand (*работு).
• We can figure out how to proceed, how to communicate, how to handle anything that comes up.
• I am speaking in Tamil.
• If a result comes and I need to know what to expect, I need it translated into Tamil.
• If it's summarized like this, we need to prepare meeting notes for today.
• This is my concept, but I don't know how it will come.
• I am testing it.
• If I speak and mix in a lot of English with Tamil, it might be difficult to understand.
• So, we need to explain it clearly.
• I don't have an idea of how to process it.
• Let's see.
